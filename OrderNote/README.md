# RecruitmentTasks_OrderNote


## Features
Magento 2 module, adds a custom note field to the order.

## Installation
Not needed, just copy the module to your Magento 2 installation.

## Posible TODOS
- change table type to varchar with length, with additional frontend validation,
- unitTests,
- translations,
- new custom table?, to be discussed, better will be to just add it to order address table,
- saving to custom table better in observer to be discussed,
- frontend preservation mechanism so note will not disapear when we move from checkout to shop and back,
